# VectorCamera
Android app that applies real-time effects to the camera input.

Vector Camera contains several image effects, including edge/outline views, color shifting, and rendering with text characters. You can save pictures and videos, change their effects, and export them as PNG and WebM files. (And HTML and text for the text rendering effects).

Vector Camera is the successor to [WireGoggles](https://github.com/dozingcat/WireGoggles) and [AsciiCam](https://github.com/dozingcat/AsciiCam) and has most of their functionality. It is written primarily in Kotlin, using the Camera2 API and RenderScript for image processing. It requires Android M or later.
