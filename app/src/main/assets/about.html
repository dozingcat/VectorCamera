            The shutter button at the top right will take a picture or start or stop a video
            recording. After taking a photo or video, it will be displayed in a view where you can
            share it with the
            <img src="img/ic_share_white_36px.svg" class="icon-small"> icon,
            change the effect with the
            <img src="img/ic_color_lens_white_36px.svg" class="icon-small"> icon,
            or delete it with the <img src="img/ic_delete_white_36px.svg" class="icon-small"> icon.

                will be red.

            NOTE: Video recordings can be very large. Every frame is stored uncompressed
            (so that you can go back and apply different effects), and depending on how quickly
            your device can process and store frames this can use 5 megabytes or more per second.
